## Overview

This work focuses on the development of a **generalized type-2 fuzzy radial basis function neural network (GT2RBFnn)** for **joint position estimation** and **adaptive EMG-based impedance control** of lower limb exoskeletons. The repository contains the full implementation of the proposed GT2RBFnn method, which aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of exoskeleton control by using **Electromyographic (EMG)** signals.

## Methodology

### GT2RBFnn Model
The core of this method is the **GT2RBFnn** which combines type-2 fuzzy logic systems with radial basis function networks. This approach helps to enhance the systemâ€™s robustness and flexibility and provide cost-efficiency.

### Loss Function Comparison
We compare different loss functions to evaluate the performance and convergence of the model during training.
